    <h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of The Web and HTML</h2>
<div class="concept">
 <div class="concept-title">  
   What is a Web Page?
  </div>
   <div class="concept-description">
     <p>A web page is a document written in a language called <em>HTML</em>. Web browsers read these documents, and then determine how to display them.</p>

       HTML
   </div>
   <div class="concept-description">
   <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents are the main documents on the web.</p>

    Coding
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p>Coding happens when programmers write in a language that a computer can understand. This language uses basic <b>HTML</B> vocabulary.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <b>Tag and Element</b>
    </p>
    <p>HTML Tags are always inside brackets. Most tags have an <em>opening</em> tag and a <em>closing</em> tag. Elements refer to everything inside a set of tags.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>
      <b>Attribute</b>
    </p>
    <p>An attribute is a property of an HTML element.

    <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>Developer Tools (in the Browser)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... 
        <br>
        In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on... 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</b>
      </p>
      <p>When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
      </p>
     </div>

            Text Editors (for programming)
          </div>
      <div class="concept-description">  
          <p>
            When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

        <div class="concept-title">
          Avoiding Repetition
        </div>
        <p>
          When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences)many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consistency:</b> By avoiding repetion, it is easy to make changes to the style of a web page.

        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
